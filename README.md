#GEMINI SERVER IN C (Name Change Pending Further Development)

Hello, this project is me trying to take what I have been learning with C network sockets and use it to do something interesting by writing a Gemini Protocol server. The Gemini Protocl is focused on being clean and easy to understand which makes it a perfect project for me to hack on and try some new things while also learning a lot along the way.

In case it isn't obvious, this currently is not a serious project. I would definetly not recommend you use this code to host your own Gemini server. There are many other much more mature projects out there that you can solve that problem for you. I am still very much learnign a lot about writing C code so I would not look towards my code as an example of how to write pretty much anything. (Though if you are a Grey Beard or even a salt and pepper beard feel free to reach out and let me know what I can improve upon.)

Otherwise, with that out of the way, please feel free to look around and take pictures!

Thanks,
CoderChristopher
